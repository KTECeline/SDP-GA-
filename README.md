Software Development Project.
Hi, we are Group A, building a project named Witchcraft.code which teaches university students to learn the programming language Python. The user will go through different game episodes that relate to various topics and Python's key functions. At the start of each level, a tutorial video will guide users to navigate through the episode and learn about the specific. Users can look at hints throughout the game if the questions are too hard. Upon finishing the game, users could get a certificate of completion and give their feedback to Witchcraft.code. The user's feedback will be visible in the admin panel. The admin can reset leaderboard, edit and delete episode questions, view feedback, view and edit certificate names, and update the user's information.
